# Grammar-Ambiguity-Tester
A Java code of a function that tests ambiguity of a context-free grammar.
I wrote this as a course project in my university.
The main method is in GrammarAnbiguityTester.java file.
You can change the function's arguments in there.
I also published four example files of CFGs, that can be edited.
Feel free to read the documentation I wrote in every Java file to understand the algorithm.
Ideas for making this code more efficient are welcomed.
Enjoy!!!
